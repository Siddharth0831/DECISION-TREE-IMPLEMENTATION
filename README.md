*DESCRIPTION*: In this task, we implemented a decision tree classifier using the Iris dataset, a classic dataset widely used for classification tasks. The goal was to build and visualize a decision tree model capable of classifying iris flowers into three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
We began by loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and class separability. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased model evaluation. Using scikit-learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier, we trained the model on the training data.
To better interpret the model, we visualized the decision tree structure using the plot_tree function, which clearly illustrated the feature-based splits and decision rules leading to classification. After training, we evaluated the model’s performance on the test set using accuracy and a classification report containing precision, recall, and F1-score.
This exercise demonstrated the decision tree’s ability to learn simple yet interpretable decision boundaries and highlighted its strengths and limitations, such as potential overfitting on small datasets. Overall, this project solidified fundamental concepts of supervised learning, decision tree structure, and evaluation metrics.
